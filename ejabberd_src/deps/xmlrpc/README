This is an HTTP 1.1 compliant XML-RPC library for Erlang. It is
designed to make it easy to write XML-RPC Erlang clients and/or
servers. The library is compliant with the XML-RPC specification
published by http://www.xmlrpc.org/.

Prior to using this library you need a recent installation of
Erlang (Erlang/OTP R12).

In order to compile the library run make on top level.

You are now ready to try the client and server examples in the
examples/ directory.

Do not forget to read doc/xmlrpc.3 (or xmlrpc.txt, xmlrpc.ps,
xmlrpc.pdf) for a detailed API description.

This library is a hack over 
http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/files/contributions/xmlrpc-1.13-ipr2.tgz 
to add support for custom HTTP headers, https transport and
case insensitive HTTP header support.
Custom HTTP headers allow to send cookies between client and server.
